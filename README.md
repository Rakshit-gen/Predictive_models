# Health Insurance Prediction Model

This repository contains a predictive model that utilizes machine learning techniques to predict health insurance based on several factors. The model reads input data from a CSV file, trains on the data, and generates predictions for health insurance coverage. Additionally, it provides the capability to store the predicted data back into the same CSV file.

## Requirements

To run the predictive model, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Pandas library (for data manipulation)
- Scikit-learn library (for machine learning algorithms)
- NumPy library (for numerical computations)

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have the CSV file containing the input data. Make sure the file is properly formatted, with each column representing the following features:

   - Age: The age of the individual (numerical value).
   - Gender: The gender of the individual (categorical value: 'male' or 'female').
   - Number of Children: The number of children the individual has (numerical value).
   - Smoking Habits: The smoking habits of the individual (categorical value: 'yes' or 'no').
   - BMI: The Body Mass Index of the individual (numerical value). It takes in height(in cm) and weight(kg) to calculate the bmi of the user.
   - Region: The region of living for the individual (categorical value: 'northeast', 'northwest', 'southeast', or 'southwest').
   - Health Insurance: The health insurance coverage (target variable).

2. Place the CSV file in the same directory as the Python script `health_insurance.py`.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

4. Run the following command to execute the script:

   ```
   python health_insurance.py --input_file data.csv
   ```

   Replace `data.csv` with the name of your input CSV file.

5. The model will read the data from the CSV file, train on the existing records, and generate predictions for the health insurance coverage.

## Customization

If you want to customize or modify the model, you can explore the `health_insurance_prediction.py` script. It contains the implementation of the predictive model using Python and scikit-learn.

Feel free to adjust the machine learning algorithm, feature selection, or data preprocessing techniques according to your requirements.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and prediction should be in CSV format. The input data should include the features mentioned above (age, gender, number of children, smoking habits, BMI, and region) with the target variable (health insurance).

Ensure that the dataset has a sufficient number of records for accurate predictions. The more diverse and representative the data is, the better the model's performance will be.
